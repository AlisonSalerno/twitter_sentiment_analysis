# Sentiment Classification of Nuclear Energy Tweets

Through classification modeling, this project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets on nuclear energy as positive, negative or neutral.

As the necessity for alternative energy resources increases due to climate change, the discussion around nuclear energy is impossible to avoid as it is a key contender. However, nuclear energy has become a divisive and polarizing topic - and so, we wanted to understand if sentiment could be easily identified around nuclear energy and what that looks like.

Predicting the sentiment of a certain tweet around nuclear energy, allows companies and lawmakers to identify specific words or phrases around nuclear energy that lend to a negative or positive perception. This allows messaging to be tailored to a specific audience without being oblivious to their opinions. For example:

  - Focusing on solutions connected to the negative words can help address concerns.
  - Highlighting the positive words can amplify the support of nuclear energy.


Our dataset contained 3,000 tweets scraped via Twint from Twitter using the search term 'Nuclear Energy'. All tweets were pulled from 2020. The sentiment of each tweet was trained using Vader and modification of its metrics. The three sentiments used in this project were: Positive, Negative and Neutral.
